## Project thoughts

I've always been interested in labor rights, so I'd like to examine data relating to that. I'd like to focus on what felt like a global increase in labor organizing over the last summer to see if labor organizing is really on the rise, and if there's any socioeconomic or political factors that could have caused any "bumps" in organizing. A global scale might be too large for analysis, so I might specifically focus in on the US. I could also examine how union membership and organization status impacts political views, voter registration, and turnout.
